    # key exchange, flips a bit in the signature inside the ServerKeyExchange
    # message from the server, and checks that the client immediately aborts the
    # handshake with a fatal alert. If the client proceeds, it means that the
    # client did not verify that the server possesses the private key
    # corresponding to the public key in the server's certificate. If so, the
    # (EC)DH key exchange is not authenticated and is thus MiTMable.
    #
    # A downside of rewriting the ClientHello to force an (EC)DH key exchange is
    # that the server might not support any (EC)DH cipher suites in which case
    # it will abort the handshake. A better solution would be for this daemon to
    # pretend to be the server and offer only (EC)DH cipher suites. However, in
    # that setup we currently do not have an easy way to modify the
    # ServerKeyExchange message or use a server certificate chain that does not
    # match the server's private key.
